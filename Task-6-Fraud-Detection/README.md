# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction features.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset)
- File: creditcard.csv
- Note: Due to large file size, the dataset is not uploaded to this repository.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Class imbalance analysis
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Output
- fraud_detection_results.csv

## Conclusion
Random Forest performed better in detecting fraudulent transactions. Class imbalance was handled using balanced class weights to improve fraud detection accuracy.
